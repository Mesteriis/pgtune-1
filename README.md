# pgtune

Pgtune - tuning PostgreSQL config by your hardware. Based upon [pgtune](https://github.com/le0pard/pgtune).  

Unlike [pgtune](https://github.com/le0pard/pgtune) this project provides an REST interface and so can be used for automated setups.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Built With

* [Micronaut](https://docs.micronaut.io/1.2.3/guide/index.html) - The central framework
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org) - Build and Dependency Management
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - The programming language

## Contributing

Since pgtune is currently part of a project work of my studies, no external contributions can be accepted at the moment. But that will change in the future.
